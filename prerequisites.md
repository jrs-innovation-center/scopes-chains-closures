## Install Node.js

Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer.

Install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

On Windows and using v4 or v5 of Node.js? Make sure you are using at least 5.1.0, which provides a fix for a bug on Windows where you can't choose items in the menu.

### Install `scope-chains-closures` with `npm`

Open your terminal and run this command:

```
npm install -g scope-chains-closures
```

The `--global` option installs this module globally so that you can run it as a command in your terminal.

#### Having issues with installation?

If you get an `EACCESS` error, the simplest way to fix this is to rerun the command, prefixed with sudo:

```
sudo npm install --global scope-chains-closures
```

You can also fix the permissions so that you don't have to use `sudo`. Take a look at this npm documentation:
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions

## Run the workshop

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
sccjs
```

You can use any editor you like.

[atom](http://atom.io) or [brackets](http://brackets.io/) are both good options.
